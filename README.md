# Modeling and Forecasting COVID-19 Dynamics in the United States Using Logistic Growth Models

## Project Overview

This project investigates the mathematical modeling and forecasting of COVID-19 dynamics in the United States using two classical population growth formulations: the **discrete logistic growth map** and the **continuous logistic growth model**.

The project explores the mathematical foundations of logistic growth, derives both model formulations, examines their equilibrium solutions and stability properties, and implements numerical simulations using Python and MATLAB.

The continuous logistic model is subsequently applied to historical U.S. COVID-19 cumulative reported case data to estimate model parameters and generate short-term forecasts.

The project emphasizes mathematical derivation, numerical implementation, parameter estimation, and model evaluation at an advanced undergraduate level.

## Research Question

Can classical discrete and continuous logistic growth models describe the progression of cumulative reported COVID-19 cases in the United States, and how effectively can the continuous logistic model forecast short-term changes in reported cases?

## Research Objectives

The primary objectives are:

1. Derive the discrete logistic growth recurrence relation.
2. Derive the continuous logistic growth differential equation and its analytical solution.
3. Analyze equilibrium points and stability conditions for both models.
4. Investigate how model parameters influence population growth behavior.
5. Implement numerical simulations using Python and MATLAB.
6. Estimate logistic model parameters from historical U.S. COVID-19 data.
7. Generate 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day forecasts.
8. Evaluate forecasting performance using statistical error metrics.
9. Compare the behavior and limitations of discrete and continuous logistic growth models.

# Mathematical Background

## 1. Discrete Logistic Growth Model

The discrete logistic growth model describes population changes over successive time steps.

The recurrence relation is:

$$
P_{n+1}=P_n+rP_n\left(1-\frac{P_n}{K}\right)
$$

Where:

- $P_n$ represents the population at time step $n$.
- $P_{n+1}$ represents the population at the next time step.
- $r$ represents the discrete growth parameter.
- $K$ represents the carrying capacity.

### Mathematical Analysis

The equilibrium points are obtained by setting:

$$
P_{n+1}=P_n=P^*
$$

This produces:

$$
P^*=0
$$

and

$$
P^*=K
$$

The stability of these equilibrium points will be examined using the derivative of the discrete mapping function.

For positive $r$, the carrying-capacity equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when:

$$
0<r<2
$$

The project will investigate how different parameter values influence the behavior of the discrete logistic map.

## 2. Continuous Logistic Growth Model

The continuous logistic growth model describes population changes over continuous time.

Its governing differential equation is:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt}=rP\left(1-\frac{P}{K}\right)
$$

Where:

- $P(t)$ represents the population at time $t$.
- $r$ represents the continuous growth rate.
- $K$ represents the carrying capacity.

### Analytical Solution

The differential equation can be solved using separation of variables and partial fraction decomposition.

The resulting analytical solution is:

$$
P(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}
$$

Where:

$$
A=\frac{K-P_0}{P_0}
$$

and $P_0$ represents the initial population.

### Equilibrium Analysis

The equilibrium solutions satisfy:

$$
\frac{dP}{dt}=0
$$

Therefore:

$$
P^*=0, P^*=K
$$

For positive growth rates:

- $P^*=0$ is unstable.
- $P^*=K$ is asymptotically stable.

### Inflection Point

The logistic growth curve reaches its maximum growth rate at:

$$
P(t)=\frac{K}{2}
$$

The corresponding inflection time is:

$$
t_{\text{inflection}}=\frac{\ln(A)}{r}
$$

This represents the point at which the modeled population transitions from accelerating growth to decelerating growth.

# Discrete vs. Continuous Logistic Growth

An important component of this project is comparing the mathematical behavior of the two logistic formulations.

| Characteristic | Discrete Logistic Model | Continuous Logistic Model |
|---|---|---|
| Mathematical formulation | Difference equation | Differential equation |
| Time representation | Discrete | Continuous |
| Solution method | Iteration | Analytical or numerical |
| Equilibrium analysis | Fixed points | Equilibrium solutions |
| Stability analysis | Discrete dynamical systems | Continuous dynamical systems |
| Numerical implementation | Recurrence iteration | Numerical integration |
| Main application | Mathematical comparison | COVID-19 forecasting |

The discrete recurrence relation can also be interpreted as an explicit Euler discretization of the continuous logistic differential equation with a time step of one.

The two formulations are related but are not generally equivalent for finite time steps.

# COVID-19 Data and Forecasting

## Dataset

The project will use historical COVID-19 data for the United States.

The primary proposed data source is:

**Our World in Data: COVID-19 Dataset**

https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus

The dataset contains reported epidemiological observations, including:

- Date
- Location
- Total confirmed cases
- New confirmed cases
- Smoothed daily cases
- Total deaths
- Vaccination statistics

The primary response variable for this project is:

$$
N(t)=\text{Cumulative reported COVID-19 cases}
$$

The analysis will focus on cumulative reported cases rather than active infections or the total number of actual infections.

## Forecasting Methodology

The continuous logistic model will be fitted to selected historical epidemic-wave data.

The model parameters are:

$$
N(t)=\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-rt}}
$$

The parameters will be estimated using nonlinear least squares.

The estimated parameters are:

- $K$: Fitted upper asymptote of the selected epidemic wave.
- $r$: Estimated continuous growth rate.
- $A$: Logistic integration parameter.

The fitted model will be used to generate forecasts over three time horizons:

| Forecast Horizon | Objective |
|---|---|
| 7 days | Short-term forecasting |
| 14 days | Intermediate short-term forecasting |
| 30 days | Longer short-term forecasting |

The forecasts will be compared against subsequently observed cumulative reported cases.

**Important:** The fitted carrying capacity is an upper asymptote for the selected model and epidemic-wave interval. It should not be interpreted as the maximum number of people who can contract COVID-19.

## Parameter Estimation

The project will investigate nonlinear least-squares estimation using Python's `scipy.optimize.curve_fit`.

The objective is to minimize:

$$
SSE=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[N_i-\hat{N}(t_i)\right]^2
$$

Where:

- $N_i$ represents the observed cumulative case count.
- $\hat{N}(t_i)$ represents the model-predicted case count.
- $n$ represents the number of observations.

The estimated parameters will be used to evaluate the model's ability to represent historical epidemic-wave behavior.

# Model Evaluation

Forecasting performance will be assessed using the following statistical metrics.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

$$
MAE=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|y_i-\hat{y}_i|
$$

### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

$$
RMSE=\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}
$$

### Coefficient of Determination ($R^2$)

$$
R^2=1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}
$$

These metrics will be used to evaluate how closely the model predictions agree with observed cumulative reported cases.

Forecast evaluation will use chronological training and testing periods to avoid data leakage.

# Limitations

The classical logistic growth model has several limitations when applied to real-world epidemic data.

1. **Multiple epidemic waves:** COVID-19 experienced multiple waves of transmission, which cannot generally be represented accurately by a single logistic curve.

2. **Changing transmission conditions:** Variants, vaccination, public-health interventions, and behavioral changes influence epidemic progression.

3. **Reporting limitations:** Confirmed case counts depend on testing availability, reporting practices, and surveillance systems.

4. **Parameter sensitivity:** Estimated parameters can vary depending on the selected observation period and initial parameter estimates.

5. **Forecasting uncertainty:** A strong historical fit does not guarantee accurate future predictions.

6. **Carrying capacity interpretation:** The estimated carrying capacity is a fitted mathematical asymptote, not a biological limit on the total number of infections.

These limitations will be considered when interpreting the forecasting results.
